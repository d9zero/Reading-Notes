## API'S ##

Apies are used in browsers, scripts, and by websites that share functionality with other programs or sites.

APIs let you write code that will make a request, asking another program or script to do something.

APIs also specify the format in which the response will be given (so that the resonse can be understood).

To use an API on your website, you will need to include a script in the relevant web pages.

An API's documentation will usually feature tables of objectsm methods, and properties.

Providing you know how to create an object and call its methods, access its properties, and respond to its events, you should be able to learn any JavaScript API.
