# In the screenshot

In the screenshots a terminal command in javascript demonstrates how to set an array in a variable. By using the var students = [`x`, `y`, `z`];
each item within quotations is included within the array 'students'. When console logged 'console.log(students);' the console return are the items `x`, `y`, and `z`.
